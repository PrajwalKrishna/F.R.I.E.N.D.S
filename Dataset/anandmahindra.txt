And there is a ‘bi-focal’ bias towards incentives for large-scale, new-age, FDI-funded manufacturing projects on the one hand &amp; start-up entrepreneurs on the other. It’s true that these two sectors have high employment generation potential (4/6)
What will revive ‘animal spirits?’ If the strong messages about respect for wealth-creators is echoed by all branches of Govt. &amp; the ‘Faceless’ e-assessment is implemented both in letter &amp; spirit it’ll go a long way in building a true partnership with Pvt enterprise.(5/6)
Increased income taxes spooked the markets.But I think the introduction of estate duty would’ve been more unnerving. Finally, the elephant analogy was most apt. If it no longer tramples on our mounds of rice, private confidence,investment AND the markets will all rebound (6/6)

Great discussion today with Israeli Ambassador Ron Malka with a focus on technology for water management given dire predictions of water scarcity. Was struck by one phrase: Israelis are schooled in being part of a ‘water-respectful culture.’ That’s the best long-term solution! https://t.co/hLLdM6Q3Pp
The Code on Wages Bill is key. Could it signal the Government’s intent to introduce significant reforms? https://t.co/NbJStSlNPu
Finally. A steady patter of rain in Mumbai. Hard to explain to non-Indians what emotions the monsoon provokes in us. The poetry of anticipation &amp; romance; the answer to our prayers; the promise of prosperity. Don’t need anything else for getting my #MondayMojo going. https://t.co/MQCDU3E3rx

Glad to be of help. Access to clean water is going to be one of India’s greatest challenges. We will step up our CSR efforts in this area. And @naandi_india has its own social enterprise @NaandiWater which is making a major dent in this area... https://t.co/JyOkQqH8Hs
These chinese videos often deal with trivial topics. At 1st glance this seemed worthy of deletion. But there are some really creative options for recycling  villainous plastic containers &amp; it gives kids something ‘sustainable’ to do on Sunday!

Last line of the article: “As yoga lovers in India &amp; elsewhere celebrate International Yoga Day today,they can rejoice in its enduring legacy.” Have to admit, I was skeptical about @narendramodi being able to get #InternationalDayOfYoga2019 approved by the UN.

With rising trade tensions between China &amp; the rest of the world as well as rising wages in China, there’s a historic opportunity for India to become a magnet for export-oriented businesses. Niti Aayog had promoted the idea of two large coastal economic zones(east &amp; west) (1/2)
A perfect time to establish those zones &amp; make them benchmarks for the ease of doing business. In fact China’s reforms began by creating SEZs that experimented with a business-friendly environment.Also a sound way to ignite growth via large Make-in-India investments (2/2)
This is wonderful. Coincidentally, I was going to tweet about the water wheel and ask whether it had become more widely used. An incredibly useful device especially during a water-scarce period.  Well done @MahindraHomeFin https://t.co/mdUnAa1p68

How cool is this? The device not only seems effective &amp; does the job, but also looks elegantly designed with a minimum of weight.

Yes, an embarrassingly easy victory for India &amp; the CWC scorecard’s 7-0 for India. Made me wonder if this is symbolic of our political relationship as well? Whether we need to bury our obsession with beating Pakistan? India has bigger fish to fry-in cricket AND in global affairs https://t.co/CsxxKy8sd4
