remember when social media didn’t exist and you didn’t care what people were doing
miss this one https://t.co/8nKFY6ZTlL
it really blows my mind how nasty people can be to each other on social media. i’ve never noticed it before gaining more attention but never thought people who don’t know each other could spew so much hate. isn’t it more energy to write something nasty then to say nothing at all?
@HoodieAllen i can’t see what you tweet at 4am because you delete it and i’m asleep like a normal person...but should i be worried?
@HoodieAllen Me?
@crewcutallen ugh i should just leave, i can’t read. Bye
