Yes, I was born in England &amp; support England at sport, but I have zero English DNA &amp; am Irish by blood &amp; birthright. https://t.co/WmzjE3yB22
I don’t mind your weirdly intense obsession with me ⁦@caitlinmoran⁩, but I do mind you misquoting me. I’ve never said a word about Meghan Markle’s jeans at Wimbledon. https://t.co/rb4em7cajH
An Irishman (and I speak as one...) who wants to captain England should sing the anthem. 
As @Eoin16, his credit, eventually acknowledged. https://t.co/4b3aseAs5L
Been a rocky journey as captain for @Eoin16. I didn’t like him not singing the anthem (he now does) &amp; he shouldn’t have bottled the Bangladesh tour. 
But he’s become an absolutely brilliant leader on &amp; off the pitch and deserves to lift that trophy on Sunday. https://t.co/376WTW3udf
How can we even be debating whether @JasonRoy20 should play in the Ashes? Of course he should. 
We should pick our most aggressive team. 
This would be my XI for 1st Test:
Roy
Bairstow
Root
Stokes 
Buttler 
Curran (S) 
Woakes
Rashid 
Archer 
Anderson 
Broad
Absolutely heart-breaking. 
My deepest condolences to Ben &amp; all his family.  RIP Iris. https://t.co/ikwY6DfNgd
Morning ‘Captain’ ⁦@6_LKOSCIELNY⁩ - kindly **** off from our club &amp; never darken our doors again. Thanks. https://t.co/md52rJ98Sl

Nonsense. If diplomats want to make scathing reports about their host countries then they shouldn’t commit them to electronic communication. Have you guys learned nothing from Wikileaks? https://t.co/A3rXLjnR4M
@KristinaSorge Congrats Sorge.. nobody has ever agreed with me about anything that much.
