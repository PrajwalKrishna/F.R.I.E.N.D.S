Dear Sarma Ji,

Sorry to disappoint you but Mission Bhagiratha was inspired by a comprehensive drinking water project executed by our CM sir in Siddipet constituency in 1998 (12 years before Gujarat)

Let me remind FM @nsitharaman Ji of Hon’ble PM’s comments from back when he was CM of Gujarat👇

Raising prices on Petrol &amp; Diesel will lead to escalation of burden on daily consumables of all Indians 

#UnionBudget2019 👎 https://t.co/eAdwrPJxnx
3 important sectors for Telangana; Life sciences &amp; Pharma, Information Technology &amp; Textiles

No support for Kakatiya Mega Textile park, not even a mention of ITIR for Hyderabad &amp; zero support for pharmaceutical &amp; life sciences sector where Hyderabad is a Hub

#UnionBudget2019 👎
Even after 5 years of formation of Telangana, no mention of the AP Bifurcation Act promises; integrated steel plant at Bayyaram, Rail Coach factory at Warangal, Tribal University etc

Why this indifference to a promising young state FM @nsitharaman Ji?

#UnionBudget2019 👎
Telangana state has repeatedly demanded national project status for either Kaleshwaram or Palamuru lift irrigation project on various forums. No mention or even acknowledgement 

Are Telangana’s projects not in the interest of our nation FM @nsitharaman Ji??

#UnionBudget2019 👎
Niti Aayog lauds Mission Kakatiya (lake restoration &amp; strengthening) &amp; Mission Bhagiratha (Drinking water Grid) &amp; recommends to Govt of India to allocate ₹24,000 Cr to these two schemes of Telangana 

Strangely, Not even ₹24 allocated by FM @nsitharaman Ji 
#UnionBudget2019 👎
Extremely disappointing &amp; insipid union budget from Telangana’s perspective. Economic survey praises Telangana’s initiatives but FM @nsitharaman Ji completely ignores a performing state’s requests for support 

#UnionBudget2019
#TrailblazerTelangana https://t.co/pMBe5MtQz4
Last year Telangana’s “Rythu Bandhu” inspired Govt of India to launch ‘PM Kisan’
