Afridi’s performance was, is and will remain imperative for the success of the team 😊. Well bowled @iShaheenAfridi &amp; the bowling unit. It’s a good opportunity for batsmen who haven’t performed as well recently to regain their form this match #CWC19 #PAKVAFG #WeHaveWeWill
Good start by the bowlers, we need to maintain the intensity and get them for a low score. Afghanistan I feel are missing batsman like Shahzad big impact losing him. #WC19
