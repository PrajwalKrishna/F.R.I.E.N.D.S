Sorry @irbishi today is not the day for @TridentSportsX on another note it was a stunner from @msdhoni and @Jaspritbumrah93 is now 6 overs 1 Maiden 9 runs and 2 wickets 🙏🙏
@cricketaakash You are correct .. it’s non conclusive and soft signal should have prevailed.
@gauravkapur IMHO why did I feel the ball brushed @ImRo45 ‘s  pad; and that’s what the mic picked up. Can’t totally digest the theory that it hit pad and bat at same tie ; a bit of zooming would help. @cricketworldcup #CWC19 #INDvsWI

@bhogleharsha @SDhawan25 he sustained the fracture and kept on playing brilliantly to put #TeamIndia  @BCCI to a comfortable total and this is not the first time ..it’s the 4 th time that he kept on playing despite getting hurt in an innings . #Team #Respect #CWC2019

The @IPL #VIVOIPL is one of the biggest celebrations of the game of cricket because of the the representation of players from around the world .Let us please refrain from using terms like Indian players vs Overseas players; they all play for the same team.
@ed_rainsford Thanks for your explanation. In that case who is at fault? A passionate player or the third umpire who have to keep the emotions aside and make the right implementation of the law. It was given OUT after review.
@ed_rainsford Ed, help me out with the new rule/law. Never shy of learning the sport that I love. I do understand if you are not a professional player it takes a lifetime to know all the rules in totality.
This is the rule; how one tries to implement is irrelevant. #AshwinMankads #KXIPvRR https://t.co/4aJREXqMxo
