@ZalimCapitalist @jaya_misra I apologise if the tone of my tweet appeared weird but I cannot understand the purpose of your tweet...wanting people to stick to using water as an unending resource when statistics FINALLY woke them up be be a little environmentally aware
@ZalimCapitalist @jaya_misra From what I understand... the lady has done a commendable job of tracing the chain but is essentially thrown off by the way this note has been framed. At no point has any comparative statistic been able to deny that India’s water crisis is real and that we will be dry in a decade
@ZalimCapitalist @jaya_misra It’s meant to alarm &amp; alert citizens because water is not endless. Have you seen 2019 monsoon reports yet? . What you’re doing is putting  people back in the same lull of unpanicked, callous water wastage... I’m shocked at the purpose of your tweet. 2/2
@ZalimCapitalist @jaya_misra I’m sorry but you are wrong. This is not a false statistic. It’s based on a UN report that assessed all potential water reservoirs including lakes and water boddies, ground water, deforestation that’s leading to an imbalanced water cycles and rains. 1/2

@VFSGlobal The UK embassy has issued my minor kids a visa that valid ONLY if their grandmother travels with them!?! We (the parents) have not neither asked for it nor submitted a consent letter for the same!! She is already in the UK! Cancelled my flights ! Kindly sort this mess!
So one thing we can all do with immediate effect is put these AERATORS in all our taps. It costs very little but you end up saving 500 litres per person or 7 litres per minute. Now multiply that with water using population. Here the link to buy one

@KrishnaAnand_ Great idea. But why penalise villages? They hardly have any water as it is... we need to curb urban and industrial wastage first.

Another super suggestion from a school parent—For everyone who uses RO filters.. please know 70% water is draining out of a pipe. Fill a bucket with that. Wash, clean, water the plants.
1) yes. For 12 years now.
2) more than anyone else who is unwilling to understand the crisis
3) ever since these reports, suspended machine till rains fill lakes.

Naysayers will point fingers rather than own actions. Shame. https://t.co/7VX5hYMgfY
