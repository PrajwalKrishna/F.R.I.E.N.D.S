@IndiGo6E Also let me repeat, his ENTIRE TOTAL WEIGHT WAS 21kg. Some Maths lessons for you : 15 +10 = 25KG. But he was made to pay 2850 AGAIN, so that’s 2850 + 2850 AGAIN = 5700 for just 6kg EXTRA. Please do explain this to me where my money is going!? And my brother also paid another 1200

@sushilrTOI Not sure how to. No idea. Just so tired of messaging him! He just doesn’t reply.
@VavvetiUsha @KeerthyOfficial @VyjayanthiFilms @SwapnaCinema @SwapnaDuttCh @nadigaiyar_offl Just feels so good.... in color :)
@shivani_keerthy @KeerthyOfficial @DazzlingKeerthy @GmFarook1 @Rohit55Ro @Kamal_Vijay007 @SriDivya_KS @sivast3 @Guna09Keerthy17 @Vijay_brother You give me diabetes. Too sweet you are! Thankyou so much. Thankyou everyone for supporting me, means a lot.
@harishkayan @Itskeerthi2k Doubt he will even bother...
@sushilrTOI Sad, but true! But why should the crew suffer? Why no action taken against such unethical work scenario.... that talks about Crores
@PranitaRavi Haha, sadly no. He is travelling the world with our money that he has to pay! Absconding. Wondering if I had gone absconding when an important costume was required? 🤔 ETHICS ARE GONE TO THE DOGS 😂😂😂😂
@PJukalker @archa_mehta @ashwinmawle @shweta_malpani @shravyavarma @nithisha_s Absolutely. Unprofessional and CHEAP. UNETHICAL. Why would anyone want to work at TFI after this? No one should work for free! I’m happy to be back in Bombay, where ppl stick to their word, and professionalism.
@Dudeabides01 Exactly the assistant directors &amp; editors who are the pillars of the film... when it comes to their pay... they never get paid! Even in this project same case, if I haven’t got as HOD .. you can Imagine their case.
@harishkayan At the moment I don’t care for anything but getting my payment. It’s disgusting behaviour. Lessons learnt!
@archa_mehta @PJukalker @ashwinmawle @shweta_malpani @shravyavarma @nithisha_s 

ever experienced this?
Why do some TFI producers not pay the crew who have worked hard on their project? A film I worked on released last year, but I am still waiting for my pay. It’s such a sad state. The producer has no professionalism to even reply. Why? When work needs to be done, do I not reply?

Happy Birthday @AlluSirish! You are the first to criticise my work, but the first to genuinely praise it, only wanting the best for me. Your refreshing insight &amp; knowledge is so vast... Thankyou for being you. I wish you all the happiness, peace, many more dream projects. 🤗

It doesn't need to be this way. Why even fight for equal pay then? #EveryCoupleIsDifferent. Accept change. Accept reality. https://t.co/9P7bnhgd7s
A community spirit is so important for us artists to grow. We all need to give 1st to take, help; it’s special to have an innercircle of work friends (yes stylists can be friends) where there is free flow of resources, healthy competition, have each other's back &amp; grow together🥂 https://t.co/KzPSyluPEW

Hi your marketing person (+91 9391039708) took an advance as some “token”
I called up immediately that day itself I’m going with another packers which is costing much lesser! Kindly RETURN MY money!!!! It’s been 3 days now @DRSAgarwal hopefully you guys will not be so cheap
//Fact//

The day you can actually help a person feel better, is when you can stop thinking it’s about you, and make it about the other person (for a change). Maybe understand *why and how* you may have gone wrong instead, to help yourself as well. You’re welcome.
@Anything4Vj_ @janu_iyer @Samanthaprabhu2 @girlofthecloth @PinkvillaSouth @MahanatiTheFilm @nadigaiyar_offl @SwapnaDuttCh @SwapnaCinema Thankyou, humbled.
How wonderfully you transformed into Madhuravani (BA Gold Medal)! Blessed to have styled the one person I always admired for her own personal style; @Samanthaprabhu2 she is a star, for a reason.
