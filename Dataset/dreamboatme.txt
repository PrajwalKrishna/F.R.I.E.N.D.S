@SaltLimeSoda Oh. I dunno.about that. I will always admire how he handled himself on n off the the field .
@SaltLimeSoda Cha feel sad that even a rahul dravid has a hater . Life spares no one n i realised I live in my bubble till social media happened to me .
@SaltLimeSoda 😳😳😳🙄😷 not gonna buy that ever . Anyway let's just end this topic here . Agree to disagree . Tata
@SaltLimeSoda I dont get u .
❤️❤️❤️❤️He truly played the Gentleman z game . Amongst all the celebs i know in various fields hes one human who should hv zero haters.
#RahulDravid ur a Wall and u stand tall
