Many years ago today, television history was made in the field of art direction, visual effects, sound design and broadcast patterns....when the moon landing was shot in a studio. 
.

I'm joking of course.

The moon landing was real..

Real good TV

Today was a tiring one. 

Morning at the VFS office. 
Half day at the Weirdass Office. 
Late Lunch on Air India to Delhi. 
Got to the hotel, got on stage. 
Evening show in Gurgaon. 
Got off stage, got back in the car. 
Dinner on Air India Back to Mumbai. 

Headed home 🙂
Imagine an India where uncles don't behave like uncles 🙂
Said it before, saying it again. Airlines come and go...but there's something about Air India staff that I like, always have. They deal with the worst of us, with a patience and basic tehzeeb no one else has.
The Air India Lounge is a journey back in time. Everything feels 20 years older. The wonderful courtesy, the polite service, the passengers but unfortunately....also the bread rolls 😐
Now being trolled by bhakts for a joke about yoga. 

You guys need to relax....maybe....try some yoga? 

I've heard it helps with a tight ass.

Keep in mind that although yoga is about the body...it's mostly about the mind. 

Trust me, I've been a yoga expert for many years now....in my mind. 

I can't touch my toes or do a perfect split...but I can visualize me doing it.
